    "A binary tree is named Even-Odd if it meets the following conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The root of the binary tree is at level index 0, its children are at level index 1, their children are at level index 2, etc.\n",
    "- For every even-indexed level, all nodes at the level have odd integer values in strictly increasing order (from left to right).\n",
    "- For every odd-indexed level, all nodes at the level have even integer values in strictly decreasing order (from left to right).\n",
    "Given the root of a binary tree, return true if the binary tree is Even-Odd, otherwise return false.\n",
    " \n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: root = [1,10,4,3,null,7,9,12,8,6,null,null,2]\n",
    "Output: true\n",
    "Explanation: The node values on each level are:\n",
    "Level 0: [1]\n",
    "Level 1: [10,4]\n",
    "Level 2: [3,7,9]\n",
    "Level 3: [12,8,6,2]\n",
    "Since levels 0 and 2 are all odd and increasing and levels 1 and 3 are all even and decreasing, the tree is Even-Odd.\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: root = [5,4,2,3,3,7]\n",
    "Output: false\n",
    "Explanation: The node values on each level are:\n",
    "Level 0: [5]\n",
    "Level 1: [4,2]\n",
    "Level 2: [3,3,7]\n",
    "Node values in level 2 must be in strictly increasing order, so the tree is not Even-Odd.\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Example 3:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: root = [5,9,1,3,5,7]\n",
    "Output: false\n",
    "Explanation: Node values in the level 1 should be even integers.\n",
    "```\n",

    "--> **Constraints:**\n",
    "```\n",
