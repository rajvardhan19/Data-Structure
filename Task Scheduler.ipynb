    "You are given an array of CPU tasks, each represented by letters A to Z, and a cooling time, n. Each cycle or interval allows the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: identical tasks must be separated by at least n intervals due to cooling time.\n",

    "â€‹Return the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks.\n",

    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: tasks = [\"A\",\"A\",\"A\",\"B\",\"B\",\"B\"], n = 2\n",

    "After completing task A, you must wait two cycles before doing A again. The same applies to task B. In the 3rd interval, neither A nor B can be done, so you idle. By the 4th cycle, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed.\n",
