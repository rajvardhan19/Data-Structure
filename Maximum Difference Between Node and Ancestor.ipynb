    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: root = [8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13]\n",

    "1. The function maxAncestorDiff is defined with a single argument root, which represents the root of a binary tree.\n",

    "\n",
    "    - node: The current node being processed.\n",
    "    - min_val: The minimum value encountered so far in the current branch.\n",
    "    - max_val: The maximum value encountered so far in the current branch.\n",

    "\n",
    "4. If the current node is not None, the function updates the min_val and max_val based on the value of the current node.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The function then recursively calls itself for the left and right children of the current node, passing along the updated min_val and max_val. It collects the results of these recursive calls in left_diff and right_diff.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The final result for the current node is the maximum of left_diff and right_diff. This ensures that the function returns the maximum ancestor difference for the current node.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The main function is called with the initial values of root.val for both min_val and max_val. This is because at the root, the minimum and maximum values encountered so far are the same.\n",

    "8. The overall result of the function is the maximum ancestor difference for the entire binary tree."
