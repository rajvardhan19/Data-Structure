    "# Find All People With Secret\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given an integer n indicating there are n people numbered from 0 to n - 1. You are also given a 0-indexed 2D integer array meetings where meetings[i] = [xi, yi, timei] indicates that person xi and person yi have a meeting at timei. A person may attend multiple meetings at the same time. Finally, you are given an integer firstPerson.\n",
    "\n",
    "Person 0 has a secret and initially shares the secret with a person firstPerson at time 0. This secret is then shared every time a meeting takes place with a person that has the secret. More formally, for every meeting, if a person xi has the secret at timei, then they will share the secret with person yi, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "The secrets are shared instantaneously. That is, a person may receive the secret and share it with people in other meetings within the same time frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return a list of all the people that have the secret after all the meetings have taken place. You may return the answer in any order.\n",
    " \n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: n = 6, meetings = [[1,2,5],[2,3,8],[1,5,10]], firstPerson = 1\n",
    "Output: [0,1,2,3,5]\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "At time 0, person 0 shares the secret with person 1.\n",
    "At time 5, person 1 shares the secret with person 2.\n",
    "At time 8, person 2 shares the secret with person 3.\n",
    "At time 10, person 1 shares the secret with person 5.​​​​\n",
    "Thus, people 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 know the secret after all the meetings.\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: n = 4, meetings = [[3,1,3],[1,2,2],[0,3,3]], firstPerson = 3\n",
    "Output: [0,1,3]\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "At time 0, person 0 shares the secret with person 3.\n",
    "At time 2, neither person 1 nor person 2 know the secret.\n",
    "At time 3, person 3 shares the secret with person 0 and person 1.\n",
    "Thus, people 0, 1, and 3 know the secret after all the meetings.\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Example 3:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: n = 5, meetings = [[3,4,2],[1,2,1],[2,3,1]], firstPerson = 1\n",
    "Output: [0,1,2,3,4]\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "At time 0, person 0 shares the secret with person 1.\n",
    "At time 1, person 1 shares the secret with person 2, and person 2 shares the secret with person 3.\n",
    "Note that person 2 can share the secret at the same time as receiving it.\n",
    "At time 2, person 3 shares the secret with person 4.\n",
    "Thus, people 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 know the secret after all the meetings.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "--> **Constraints:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "2 <= n <= 105\n",
    "1 <= meetings.length <= 105\n",
    "meetings[i].length == 3\n",
    "0 <= xi, yi <= n - 1\n",

    "1 <= timei <= 105\n",
