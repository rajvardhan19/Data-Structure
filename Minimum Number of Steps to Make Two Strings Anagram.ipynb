    "You are given two strings of the same length s and t. In one step you can choose any character of t and replace it with another character.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the minimum number of steps to make t an anagram of s.\n",
    "\n",
    "An Anagram of a string is a string that contains the same characters with a different (or the same) ordering.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: s = \"bab\", t = \"aba\"\n",
    "Output: 1\n",
    "Explanation: Replace the first 'a' in t with b, t = \"bba\" which is anagram of s.\n",

    "Output: 5\n",
    "Explanation: Replace 'p', 'r', 'a', 'i' and 'c' from t with proper characters to make t anagram of s.\n",

    "```\n",
