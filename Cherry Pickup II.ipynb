    "You are given a rows x cols matrix grid representing a field of cherries where grid[i][j] represents the number of cherries that you can collect from the (i, j) cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have two robots that can collect cherries for you:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Robot #1 is located at the top-left corner (0, 0), and\n",
    "    - Robot #2 is located at the top-right corner (0, cols - 1).\n",
    "Return the maximum number of cherries collection using both robots by following the rules below:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - From a cell (i, j), robots can move to cell (i + 1, j - 1), (i + 1, j), or (i + 1, j + 1).\n",
    "    - When any robot passes through a cell, It picks up all cherries, and the cell becomes an empty cell.\n",
    "    - When both robots stay in the same cell, only one takes the cherries.\n",
    "    - Both robots cannot move outside of the grid at any moment.\n",
    "    - Both robots should reach the bottom row in grid.\n",

    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: grid = [[3,1,1],[2,5,1],[1,5,5],[2,1,1]]\n",

    "Explanation: Path of robot #1 and #2 are described in color green and blue respectively.\n",
    "Cherries taken by Robot #1, (3 + 2 + 5 + 2) = 12.\n",
    "Cherries taken by Robot #2, (1 + 5 + 5 + 1) = 12.\n",
    "Total of cherries: 12 + 12 = 24.\n",
