    "# Problem Name: Minimum Time to Make Rope Colorful\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice has n balloons arranged on a rope. You are given a 0-indexed string colors where colors[i] is the color of the ith balloon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice wants the rope to be colorful. She does not want two consecutive balloons to be of the same color, so she asks Bob for help. Bob can remove some balloons from the rope to make it colorful. You are given a 0-indexed integer array neededTime where neededTime[i] is the time (in seconds) that Bob needs to remove the ith balloon from the rope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the minimum time Bob needs to make the rope colorful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: colors = \"abaac\", neededTime = [1,2,3,4,5]\n",
    "Output: 3\n",
    "Explanation: In the above image, 'a' is blue, 'b' is red, and 'c' is green.\n",
    "Bob can remove the blue balloon at index 2. This takes 3 seconds.\n",
    "There are no longer two consecutive balloons of the same color. Total time = 3.\n",

    "```\n",
    "Input: colors = \"abc\", neededTime = [1,2,3]\n",
    "Output: 0\n",
    "Explanation: The rope is already colorful. Bob does not need to remove any balloons from the rope.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Example 3:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: colors = \"aabaa\", neededTime = [1,2,3,4,1]\n",
    "Output: 2\n",
    "Explanation: Bob will remove the ballons at indices 0 and 4. Each ballon takes 1 second to remove.\n",
    "There are no longer two consecutive balloons of the same color. Total time = 1 + 1 = 2.\n",

    "- Dynamic Programming Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a dynamic programming (DP) approach to solve this problem efficiently.\n",

    "Set dp[i][i] = 0 for all i (representing substrings of length 1, which need no removal).\n",
    "- DP State Transition:\n",
    "\n",
    "We iterate through all possible substring lengths, starting from length 2 up to the length of the whole rope.\n",
    "For each substring length, consider all possible substrings of that length and update the minimum time needed accordingly.\n",
    "- Subproblem Breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Within the iteration, we consider all possible splits within the current substring and check the colors at those splits.\n",
    "    - If the colors at the splits are different, we consider the subproblems for the two split parts and update the minimum time needed.\n",
    "    - If the colors at the ends of the substring are the same, indicating two consecutive balloons with the same color:\n",
    "        - We consider the time to remove the first and last balloons (neededTime[i] and neededTime[j]) and the time needed for the inner substring (dp[i+1][j-1]).\n",
    "        - Update the minimum time needed for this case as neededTime[i] + neededTime[j] + dp[i+1][j-1].\n",
    "- Final Result:\n",
    "\n",
    "The minimum time needed to make the entire rope colorful is stored in dp[0][n-1], where n is the length of the rope."
