    "# Problem Name: Assign Cookies\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]\n",
    "Output: 1\n",
    "Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. \n",
    "And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.\n",

    "Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. \n",
    "You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, \n",
