    "# Maximum Odd Binary Number\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a binary string s that contains at least one '1'.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to rearrange the bits in such a way that the resulting binary number is the maximum odd binary number that can be created from this combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return a string representing the maximum odd binary number that can be created from the given combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the resulting string can have leading zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: s = \"010\"\n",
    "Output: \"001\"\n",
    "Explanation: Because there is just one '1', it must be in the last position. So the answer is \"001\".\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: s = \"0101\"\n",
    "Output: \"1001\"\n",
    "Explanation: One of the '1's must be in the last position. The maximum number that can be made with the remaining digits is \"100\". So the answer is \"1001\".\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "--> **Constraints:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "1 <= s.length <= 100\n",
    "s consists only of '0' and '1'.\n",
    "s contains at least one '1'.\n",
    "```\n",
