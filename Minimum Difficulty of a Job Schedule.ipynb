    "# Problem Name: Minimum Difficulty of a Job Schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to schedule a list of jobs in ```d``` days. Jobs are dependent (i.e To work on the ```ith``` job, you have to finish all the jobs ```j``` where ```0 <= j < i```).\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to finish at least one task every day. The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the ```d``` days. The difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done on that day.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given an integer array ```jobDifficulty``` and an integer d. The difficulty of the ith job is ```jobDifficulty[i]```.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the minimum difficulty of a job schedule. If you cannot find a schedule for the jobs return ```-1```.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: jobDifficulty = [6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 2\n",
    "Output: 7\n",
    "Explanation: First day you can finish the first 5 jobs, total difficulty = 6.\n",
    "Second day you can finish the last job, total difficulty = 1.\n",
    "The difficulty of the schedule = 6 + 1 = 7 \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: jobDifficulty = [9,9,9], d = 4\n",
    "Output: -1\n",
    "Explanation: If you finish a job per day you will still have a free day. you cannot find a schedule for the given jobs.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 3:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: jobDifficulty = [1,1,1], d = 3\n",
    "Output: 3\n",
    "Explanation: The schedule is one job per day. total difficulty will be 3.\n",
    "```\n",
    " \n",
    "--> **Constraints:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "-> 1 <= jobDifficulty.length <= 300\n",
    "-> 0 <= jobDifficulty[i] <= 1000\n",
    "-> 1 <= d <= 10\n",
    "```\n",

    "1. Initialization:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The code initializes a 2D DP array (dp) with dimensions (n + 1) x (d + 1) where n is the number of jobs and d is the number of days available.\n",
    "    - dp[i][j] represents the minimum difficulty to complete i jobs in j days.\n",
    "    - It sets dp[0][0] = 0 as the base case where there are 0 jobs to do in 0 days, hence the difficulty is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Main DP Loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Nested loops iterate through the dp array.\n",
    "        - i represents the number of jobs considered so far.\n",
    "        - j represents the number of days considered so far.\n",
    "    - Within this loop:\n",
    "        - max_difficulty is initialized as 0. It keeps track of the maximum difficulty encountered for a particular job sequence.\n",
    "        - Another inner loop (for k in range(i, 0, -1)) iterates over previous job sequences to calculate the minimum difficulty.\n",
    "        - It updates max_difficulty with the maximum of the current job's difficulty and the previous maximum difficulty.\n",
    "        - dp[i][j] is updated by taking the minimum of its current value and the sum of the previous day's difficulty (dp[k - 1][j - 1]) and the maximum difficulty encountered (max_difficulty).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Return:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, it returns dp[n][d] if it is not equal to float('inf'), which indicates that a valid job schedule exists. Otherwise, it returns -1, implying that it's impossible to find a schedule to complete the jobs in the given number of days."
