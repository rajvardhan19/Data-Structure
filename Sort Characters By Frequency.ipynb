    "# Sort Characters By Frequency\n",
    "Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.\n",
    " \n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: s = \"tree\"\n",
    "Output: \"eert\"\n",
    "Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.\n",
    "So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore \"eetr\" is also a valid answer.\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: s = \"cccaaa\"\n",
    "Output: \"aaaccc\"\n",
    "Explanation: Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so both \"cccaaa\" and \"aaaccc\" are valid answers.\n",
    "Note that \"cacaca\" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 3:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: s = \"Aabb\"\n",
    "Output: \"bbAa\"\n",
    "Explanation: \"bbaA\" is also a valid answer, but \"Aabb\" is incorrect.\n",
    "Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "--> **Constraints:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "1 <= s.length <= 5 * 105\n",
    "s consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters and digits.\n",
    "```\n",
