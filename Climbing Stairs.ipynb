    "1. Base Cases:\n",
    "    - If n is less than or equal to 2, it means there are only n steps or fewer. In such cases, the function directly returns n because there are n distinct ways to climb n steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Dynamic Programming Array:\n",
    "    - The function initializes a dynamic programming array dp of size (n + 1) to store the number of distinct ways to reach each step. dp[i] represents the number of ways to climb to step i.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Base Values for 1 and 2 Steps:\n",
    "    - The function sets dp[1] = 1 and dp[2] = 2 because there is 1 way to climb 1 step and 2 ways to climb 2 steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Dynamic Programming Iteration:\n",
    "    - The function then iterates from step 3 to step n. For each step i, the number of ways to reach that step is the sum of the ways to reach the previous two steps (i - 1 and i - 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Return Result:\n",
    "    - Finally, the function returns the number of distinct ways to climb to the top, which is stored in dp[n]."
