    "A polygon is a closed plane figure that has at least 3 sides. The longest side of a polygon is smaller than the sum of its other sides.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, if you have k (k >= 3) positive real numbers a1, a2, a3, ..., ak where a1 <= a2 <= a3 <= ... <= ak and a1 + a2 + a3 + ... + ak-1 > ak, then there always exists a polygon with k sides whose lengths are a1, a2, a3, ..., ak.\n",
