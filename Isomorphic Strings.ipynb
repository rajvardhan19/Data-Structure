    "Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.\n",

    "All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.  \n",

    "```\n",
    "Input: s = \"egg\", t = \"add\"\n",
