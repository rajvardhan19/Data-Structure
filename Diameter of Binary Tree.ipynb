    "Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.\n",
    "\n",
    "The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.\n",

    "```\n",
    "Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]\n",
    "Output: 3\n",
    "Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].\n",

    "The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].\n",
