    "A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For example, ```[1, 3, 5, 7, 9], [7, 7, 7, 7],``` and ```[3, -1, -5, -9]``` are arithmetic sequences.\n",
    "- For example, ```[1, 1, 2, 5, 7]``` is not an arithmetic sequence.\n",

    "A subsequence of an array is a sequence that can be formed by removing some elements (possibly none) of the array.\n",
