    "# Problem Name: Design a Food Rating System\n",
    "Design a food rating system that can do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Modify the rating of a food item listed in the system.\n",
    "-> Return the highest-rated food item for a type of cuisine in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the ```FoodRatings ```class:\n",
    "\n",
    "-> ```FoodRatings(String[] foods, String[] cuisines, int[] ratings)``` Initializes the system. The food items are described by ```foods```, ```cuisines``` and ```ratings```, all of which have a length of ``` n```.\n",
    "    -> ```foods[i]``` is the name of the ```ith ```food,\n",
    "    -> ```cuisines[i]``` is the type of cuisine of the ```ith``` food, and\n",
    "    -> ```ratings[i]``` is the initial rating of the ```ith``` food.\n",
    "-> ```void changeRating(String food, int newRating)``` Changes the rating of the food item with the name ```food```.\n",
    "-> ```String highestRated(String cuisine)``` Returns the name of the food item that has the highest rating for the given type of ```cuisine```. If there is a tie, return the item with the **lexicographically smaller** name.\n",
    "Note that a string ```x ```is lexicographically smaller than string ```y``` if ```x``` comes before ```y``` in dictionary order, that is, either ```x``` is a prefix of ```y```, or if ```i``` is the first position such that ```x[i] != y[i]```, then ```x[i]``` comes before ```y[i]``` in alphabetic order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: [\"FoodRatings\", \"highestRated\", \"highestRated\", \"changeRating\", \"highestRated\", \"changeRating\", \"highestRated\"]\n",
    "[[[\"kimchi\", \"miso\", \"sushi\", \"moussaka\", \"ramen\", \"bulgogi\"], [\"korean\", \"japanese\", \"japanese\", \"greek\", \"japanese\", \"korean\"], [9, 12, 8, 15, 14, 7]], [\"korean\"], [\"japanese\"], [\"sushi\", 16], [\"japanese\"], [\"ramen\", 16], [\"japanese\"]]\n",
    "Output: [null, \"kimchi\", \"ramen\", null, \"sushi\", null, \"ramen\"] \n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: FoodRatings foodRatings = new FoodRatings([\"kimchi\", \"miso\", \"sushi\", \"moussaka\", \"ramen\", \"bulgogi\"], [\"korean\", \"japanese\", \"japanese\", \"greek\", \"japanese\", \"korean\"], [9, 12, 8, 15, 14, 7]);\n",
    "foodRatings.highestRated(\"korean\"); // return \"kimchi\"\n",
    "                                    // \"kimchi\" is the highest rated korean food with a rating of 9.\n",
    "foodRatings.highestRated(\"japanese\"); // return \"ramen\"\n",
    "                                      // \"ramen\" is the highest rated japanese food with a rating of 14.\n",
    "foodRatings.changeRating(\"sushi\", 16); // \"sushi\" now has a rating of 16.\n",
    "foodRatings.highestRated(\"japanese\"); // return \"sushi\"\n",
    "                                      // \"sushi\" is the highest rated japanese food with a rating of 16.\n",
    "foodRatings.changeRating(\"ramen\", 16); // \"ramen\" now has a rating of 16.\n",
    "foodRatings.highestRated(\"japanese\"); // return \"ramen\"\n",
    "                                      // Both \"sushi\" and \"ramen\" have a rating of 16.\n",
    "                                      // However, \"ramen\" is lexicographically smaller than \"sushi\".\n",

    "--> **Constraints:**\n",
    " 1 <= n <= 2 * 104\n",
    " n == foods.length == cuisines.length == ratings.length\n",
    " 1 <= foods[i].length, cuisines[i].length <= 10\n",
    " foods[i], cuisines[i] consist of lowercase English letters.\n",
    " 1 <= ratings[i] <= 108\n",
    " All the strings in foods are distinct.\n",
    " food will be the name of a food item in the system across all calls to changeRating.\n",
    " cuisine will be a type of cuisine of at least one food item in the system across all calls to highestRated.\n",
    " At most 2 * 104 calls in total will be made to changeRating and highestRated.\n",
