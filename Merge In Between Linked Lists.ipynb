    "# Merge In Between Linked Lists\n",
    "You are given two linked lists: list1 and list2 of sizes n and m respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remove list1's nodes from the ath node to the bth node, and put list2 in their place.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given an array of CPU tasks, each represented by letters A to Z, and a cooling time, n. Each cycle or interval allows the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: identical tasks must be separated by at least n intervals due to cooling time.\n",
    "\n",
    "â€‹Return the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: list1 = [10,1,13,6,9,5], a = 3, b = 4, list2 = [1000000,1000001,1000002]\n",
    "Output: [10,1,13,1000000,1000001,1000002,5]\n",
    "Explanation: We remove the nodes 3 and 4 and put the entire list2 in their place. The blue edges and nodes in the above figure indicate the result.\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: list1 = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6], a = 2, b = 5, list2 = [1000000,1000001,1000002,1000003,1000004]\n",

    "\n",
    "--> **Constraints:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "3 <= list1.length <= 104\n",
    "1 <= a <= b < list1.length - 1\n",
    "1 <= list2.length <= 104\n",
